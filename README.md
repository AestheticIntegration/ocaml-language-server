# caml-language-server

A language server for Caml family languages

## Synopsis

This is an implementation of Microsoft's [Language
Server](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) protocol for
[Caml family](http://caml.inria.fr/about/history.en.html) languages such as
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org) and [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason). It
is intended to be used as a backend for rich editor plugins like
[vscode-reasonml](https://github.com/freebroccolo/vscode-reasonml).

## Status

The server is not currently usable but basic functionality should be in place soon.
